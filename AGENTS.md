# Database migrations

- Apply existing SQL through the managed migration tool and isolate unsupported data or bucket operations in dedicated tools because database changes must be recorded.
- Grant Data API privileges to new application tables and use security-invoker views so row-level policies remain effective.
- Assign email-based administrative roles only after email verification, including the verification lifecycle event, to prevent mailbox impersonation.
